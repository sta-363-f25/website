This means you must be on the eduroam wireless network, or connected through the VPN if you are off-campus.\n\nIf you are off-campus, go through the VPN first: WFU VPN Instructions.\n\nGo to login.deac.wfu.edu and sign in with your school email and password.\nOnce logged in, click the RStudio icon.\nSet your working directory to /deac/sta/classes/sta363/YOUR-USERNAME where YOUR-USERNAME is replaced by the first part of your email address, i.e., mine is mcgowald because my email is mcgowald@wfu.edu\nSet the number of hours to how long you plan to work on the project (I usually enter 4).\nClick Launch.\nThe session will show as Queued for a moment. Once it is ready, the status will turn green and say Ready.\nClick the Connect to RStudio Server button. You should now be in RStudio Pro.\n\n\nNote: You are not required to use this setup (i.e., you can download RStudio and all the necessary packages locally). However, the focus of this class is not on technical setup, so we will not be able to spend time troubleshooting issues if you are not using the official setup described here.",

Instances of academic dishonesty will be referred to the Honor and Ethics Council.\n\nSharing code & responses\n\nThere are many online resources for sharing code (for example, StackOverflow) - you may use these resources but must explicitly cite where you have obtained code (both code you used directly and “paraphrased” code / code used as inspiration).
